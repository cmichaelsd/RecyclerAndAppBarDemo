# RecyclerAndAppBarDemo
> A project to show how to use a recycler view with a card layout, sample data, and app bar.
> A card layout is a component which offers styling specific to recycler view items.
> Sample data was used in an IDE generated folder called sampledata where sample data is injected into the design view in the form of a JSON object to show what the expected recycler view will look like.
> The Toolbar is wrapped in a CollapsingAppBar element which provides default styling and animation for the toolbar.
> The CoordinatorLayout coordinates different layout objects together, the scrolling portion of the screen content_main as an attribute app:layout_behavior="@string/appbar_scrolling_view_behavior" to associate the appbar scrolling behavior with the content_main layout.
